## Data


### Traffic data

  - This is an average taxi speed datasets of Seoul, South Korea. The original data is retrieved from !TOPIS(https://topis.seoul.go.kr). TOPIS aggregates the raw GPS tracking data collected from DTG (Digital Tacho Graph) on Seoul taxis into 5 min resolution. To use the dataset for evaluation of traffic forecasting models, we processed the dataset and defined two study areas - (1) urban-core, and (2) urban-mix Urban-core, located in Gangnam-gu, Seoul, is populated with rather homogeneous 304 links. Urban-mix is an expansion of Urban-core, and it is populated with heterogeneous 1,007 links. The data ranges from 2018.04.01 ~ 2018.04.30 (1 month)
